# Herbal Medicine Formula Calculator

## Overview
This project is a web application designed for managing and calculating herbal medicine formulas. It allows practitioners to create custom formulas by selecting ingredients and specifying their relative amounts, which are then automatically scaled to meet a desired total mass. The application also calculates the cost for each formula based on the ingredients used.

## Features
- Create and manage custom herbal medicine formulas
- Automatically scale ingredient amounts to meet a specified total mass
- Calculate the cost of each formula based on individual ingredient costs
- Add, edit, and delete ingredients from the formula
- Override default markup values for individual ingredients

## Planned and Requested Improvements
- **List Conditions for each formula and date created**: Automatically copy date and conditions to clipboard (with formula data).
- **Formula Names**: Enable user naming of formulas.
- **Delete Ingredients**: Create page dedicated to display/add/edit/delete ingredients.
- **Database Integration**: Implementing a backend database to store and retrieve formulas, ingredients, and patient data.
- **User Authentication**: Adding user authentication to ensure data privacy and security.
- **Reporting Features**: Developing reporting capabilities to track formula usage, popular ingredients, and cost analysis.
- **Formula History**: Maintaining a history of created formulas for easy access and modification.
- **Ingredient Database**: Expanding the ingredient database with more comprehensive information, including potential allergens and contraindications.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporating a system to gather and implement user feedback for continuous improvement.
